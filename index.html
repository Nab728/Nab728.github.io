    <p>Hey What's up! This is one of the very first personal projects that I've ever
        done that includes multiple pages with 2 forms that you can fill up. 
        However, I can't really see any of  that info because so far I haven't learn php.
        So deal with it for now because I might learn php in the future.<br><br>

        If you want to to check out my expertise and like to fill out a shitty form for an anime
        recommendation from me that I will review the form and send you an email back about
        what anime I sugguest you watch next or what anime to start with. 
        Click the link below to get redirected to my form. <br><br>
        <a href="index.html" id="animeform">Click Here</a>
    </p>
<!-- Oh yea don't ask why I changed the nav design, I intially did the form, about me, and contact before the 
home page and intially wanted the nav layout to look like the home html but that took too long so
I did the regular box model one. -->
